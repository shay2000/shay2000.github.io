development environment for community contributions.

Linux packaging includes a similar development script, so the same guide
can be applied there too.

## Credits

### The Chromium project
[The Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/) is at the core of Helium,
making it possible in the first place.

### ungoogled-chromium
This repo is based on [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium),
but heavily modified for Helium. Special thanks to everyone behind ungoogled-chromium,
they made working with Chromium way easier.

### Other Chromium browsers

Helium includes some patches from other open source Chromium browsers:

- [Inox patchset](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)
- [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/chromium-browser)
- [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite)
- [Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de/)
- [Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-core)

All patches are sorted by vendor in the [patches](https://github.com/shay2000/helium-dia/blob/main/patches/) directory of this repo.
