# PodcastSync

Turn YouTube channels into your own personal podcast.

PodcastSync watches YouTube channels you choose, saves the audio of new videos
as they come out, and turns them into a podcast you can listen to in any
podcast app — just like a normal podcast subscription, except you pick the
content.

You run it once on a server (a small rented computer in the cloud), and after
that it works on its own. It is private: only you can reach it.

## Don't want to do it yourself? Give this to your AI assistant

If you use an AI assistant that can run commands for you (Claude Code, Codex,
Cursor, Kilo, and the like), copy the one line below, paste it into a chat
with it, and it will set the whole thing up for you, checking with you
whenever it needs a decision.

```text
Set up PodcastSync on my server: download the repo from https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS, read SETUP.md in it, and follow it exactly.
```

That's all you need to give it — the repo's `SETUP.md` contains the full
step-by-step instructions for the agent, including the safety rules.

## What it does

1. You add YouTube channels you like (for example, a cooking channel or a
   news channel).
2. PodcastSync quietly checks those channels for new videos.
3. When it finds one, it saves just the audio.
4. Your podcast app downloads new episodes automatically, like any podcast.

That's it. Subscribe once in your podcast app and new videos show up as
episodes by themselves.

## What you need before starting

- **A server** — a small cloud computer running Linux (any cheap one works).
  If you already have one set up with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (a
  tool that lets your devices talk to each other privately over the
  internet), you are ready.
- **Docker installed on that server** — Docker is a tool that runs apps in
  tidy, self-contained packages. Your server provider or a tech-savvy friend
  can set this up in a few minutes.
- **10 minutes.**

No programming knowledge is needed beyond copying and pasting two commands.

## Setting it up

### Step 1 — Install PodcastSync on your server

Log in to your server, then run this one command (copy it exactly):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/main/deploy/linux/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads PodcastSync and starts it. When it finishes, you will see a
message saying it is running and healthy.

> Using Tailscale? Run the version below instead, replacing `100.x.y.z` with
> your server's Tailscale address (run `tailscale ip -4` on the server to see
> it). Then you can open PodcastSync from any of your devices on your Tailnet.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/main/deploy/linux/install.sh | bash -s -- --bind-ip 100.x.y.z
```

### Step 2 — Open the dashboard

Go to this address in your web browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8642
```

(or `http://100.x.y.z:8642` if you used the Tailscale version)

This is your PodcastSync dashboard — a simple web page where you manage
everything.

### Step 3 — Add a YouTube channel

1. On the dashboard, find the **Add Source** box.
2. Paste in the web address of a YouTube channel, for example
   `https://www.youtube.com/@cookingchannel`.
3. Give it a name (anything you like).
4. Click **Add**, then click **Sync Now**.

PodcastSync starts saving audio from that channel. The first sync can take a
little while if the channel has many videos.

### Step 4 — Subscribe in your podcast app

1. On the dashboard, click **Copy Feed URL** next to your channel.
2. In your podcast app (Apple Podcasts, Downcast, and most others work):
   - Apple Podcasts: **File → Subscribe to Show by URL**, then paste.
   - Other apps: look for "Add by URL" or "Subscribe by URL", then paste.

Done! New videos from that channel now appear in your podcast app
automatically, as audio-only episodes.

## Everyday use

- **Listen**: in your podcast app, like any other podcast.
- **Add more channels**: dashboard → Add Source.
- **Pause a channel**: open the channel on the dashboard and toggle it off.
- **Update PodcastSync**: log in to the server and re-run the same install
  command from Step 1. Your channels and saved episodes are kept.

## Optional extras

**Better video history (recommended).** Without extra setup, PodcastSync can
only see about the 15 most recent videos on a channel. A free
*YouTube API key* removes that limit and shows the full history. Get one at
the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
(create a project → enable "YouTube Data API v3" → create an API key), then
paste it into the dashboard under **Settings**.

**Locked or members-only videos.** Very occasionally a video requires being
signed in to YouTube. For those, you can provide a "cookies file" — see
[HANDOFF.md](https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/blob/main/HANDOFF.md) for the details.

**Listening from podcast apps that live in the cloud** (like Overcast). Those
apps fetch feeds from the internet, so a private server isn't enough for them —
you need a public web address for just the feed part. Don't worry: you don't
need to buy a domain name. A free address from [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org)
works (create a name like `my-podcasts.duckdns.org`, point it at your server,
and follow the short steps in [HANDOFF.md](https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/blob/main/HANDOFF.md) — the app handles the
secure certificate by itself). Only the podcast feed and audio become public;
your dashboard stays private. Apps like Apple Podcasts and Downcast work
without any of this.

## Good to know

- **It's private.** Only you can reach your PodcastSync and your saved audio.
  Do not share the dashboard address publicly.
- **Your podcasts depend on the server.** If the server is off, podcast apps
  can't fetch new episodes (already-downloaded episodes keep working).
- **Be patient with podcast apps.** They sometimes take up to an hour to
  notice new episodes.
- **Personal use only.** Please respect the rights of the people whose videos
  you save — keep it to yourself.

## For developers and tinkerers

Everything technical — the API, running it locally, the Docker image,
deployment runbooks — lives in [HANDOFF.md](https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/blob/main/HANDOFF.md) and
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS/blob/main/AGENTS.md). The short version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shay2000/PodcastSync-VPS.git
cd PodcastSync-VPS
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -q      # offline test suite
./scripts/dev.sh               # dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8642
```

Releases are Docker images on GHCR (`ghcr.io/shay2000/podcastsync`), built
for amd64 and arm64 by CI on every `v*` tag.
