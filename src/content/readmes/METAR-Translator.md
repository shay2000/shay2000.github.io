METAR Viewer fetches and decodes aviation weather reports (METARs) into plain English.
Search by ICAO code, IATA code, airport name, or even a common misspelling, and get
wind, visibility, cloud layers, temperature, altimeter, present weather, and flight
category back in a readable form.

It ships in **three flavours**, all built from this one branch: a Windows desktop app,
a macOS desktop app, and an in-game toolbar panel for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

> **Simulation use only.** This project is for flight simulation and hobby use. Never
> use it for real-world aviation, flight planning, navigation, or weather decisions.

## What's in this repository

`main` is the single source of truth and contains **all three versions at once**.
Develop and release from this branch; the platform-specific implementations live in
their sibling projects and workflows.

All three versions share the same METAR decoding engine (`MetarViewer.Core`), so a
parsing fix benefits every version at once.

## Which version do I want?

| Version | What it is | Runs on | Release to download |

Each version is published as its **own** release. The current platform releases are
[Windows 1.0.7](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/win-v1.0.7),
[Mac 1.0.0](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/mac-v1.0.0), and
[MSFS 2020 1.0.1](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/msfs-v1.0.1).
Each platform maintains its own version sequence, while the three tags identify builds
from their exact release source snapshots. Future coordinated releases create all three
tags from the same `main` commit.

Pick a desktop app if you want to look up weather on its own; pick the MSFS package if
you want weather without leaving the cockpit. Installing one does not affect the others.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/main/docs/assets/icon-windows.svg" width="20" height="20" align="top" alt=""> Windows desktop app

A self-contained single-file executable — no .NET runtime, installer, or admin rights
needed.

1. Download `METAR-Viewer-Windows-x64-<version>.exe` from the
   [METAR Viewer for Windows 1.0.7 release](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/win-v1.0.7).
2. Double-click it.


Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognised publisher because the build is not
code-signed. Choose **More info → Run anyway** if you trust the download.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/main/docs/assets/icon-apple.svg" width="20" height="20" align="top" alt=""> macOS desktop app

1. Open the [METAR Viewer for Mac 1.0.0 release](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/mac-v1.0.0)
   and download the disk image for your Mac:
   - `METAR-Viewer-Mac-Apple-Silicon-<version>.dmg` for M-series Macs.
   - `METAR-Viewer-Mac-Intel-<version>.dmg` for Intel Macs.
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag **METAR Viewer** into your Applications folder.
3. Launch it.

The DMG is ad-hoc signed rather than notarised, so on first launch macOS Gatekeeper may
refuse to open it. Right-click the app and choose **Open**, or allow it under **System
Settings → Privacy & Security**.


### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/main/docs/assets/icon-msfs.svg" width="20" height="20" align="top" alt=""> MSFS 2020 in-game panel

This version runs entirely inside the simulator. There is no separate app, background
service, or custom installer — it is a normal MSFS Community package.

The panel asks the simulator for weather first, falls back to the VATSIM METAR API when
the simulator has no report, and decodes everything locally.

Download `metar-viewer-toolbar.zip` from the
[METAR Viewer for MSFS 2020 1.0.1 release](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/releases/tag/msfs-v1.0.1),
or grab it from the
[Flightsim.to page](https://flightsim.to/addon/106602/metar-translator).


> A source checkout is **not** installable on its own. `manifest.json`, `layout.json`,
> and the toolbar registration have to be generated first — see
> [Build from source](#build-from-source).

1. Close Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 completely.
2. Open your Community folder. If you do not know the path, start MSFS and use
   **Developer Mode → Tools → Virtual File System → Packages Folders → Open Community
   Folder**, then close MSFS again before copying. Alternatively find
   `InstalledPackagesPath` in `UserCfg.opt` and open its `Community` subfolder. Do not
   use `Official`.
3. Extract the ZIP directly into the Community folder.
4. Confirm the package metadata sits at the package root:

   ```text
   Community\
   └── metar-viewer-toolbar\
       ├── manifest.json
       ├── layout.json
       ├── InGamePanels\
       └── html_ui\
   ```

   If you see `metar-viewer-toolbar\metar-viewer-toolbar\...`, move the inner folder up
   one level. Do not copy the repository's `integrations\msfs2020` folder into Community.

5. Start MSFS 2020, begin a flight, and pick **METAR Viewer** from the toolbar. It may
   be hidden in the toolbar overflow menu if you have many panels installed.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md).

**What the panel does**

- Requests weather from the simulator's facility service first.
- Falls back to the VATSIM METAR API when the simulator has no report or the request fails.
- Searches airports through AirportsAPI for names and IATA codes.
- Still accepts a direct four-letter ICAO code when airport search is unavailable.
- Decodes wind, visibility, clouds, temperature, altimeter, weather, and flight category locally.
- Briefly caches successful results to avoid repeated requests.
- Remembers the last station when the simulator data-store is available.

An internet connection is needed for airport-name/IATA lookup and the VATSIM fallback.
The simulator METAR path still works without them when MSFS has the report.

## Troubleshooting

### MSFS: the toolbar icon does not appear

- Make sure MSFS was closed while you copied the package, and restarted afterwards.
- Confirm `manifest.json` and `layout.json` are directly inside `metar-viewer-toolbar`.
- Make sure you copied the *built* package folder, not the repository or `PackageSources`.
- Temporarily remove other toolbar panel mods if the toolbar is unstable after a sim update.
- With Developer Mode on, check **Tools → Packages** for `metar-viewer-toolbar`.

### The app or panel cannot find weather

- Try a direct ICAO code such as `EGLL`, `KJFK`, or `OMDB`.
- Check your internet connection for airport search and the VATSIM fallback.
- Wait a minute and refresh; public weather services are occasionally unavailable.

### Removing or updating the MSFS package

Close MSFS, then delete or replace only the `Community\metar-viewer-toolbar` folder.
Never hand-edit `layout.json` or `manifest.json` inside a packaged release.

## Repository structure

Every version lives on `main` as sibling projects in one solution:

```text
src/
  MetarViewer.Core/            Shared parsing, models and services. No UI code.
  MetarViewer.App.Avalonia/    Cross-platform desktop UI -> ships Windows .exe + macOS .dmg
  MetarViewer.App.WinUI/       Alternative Windows-native WinUI 3 UI. Windows-only build.
integrations/
  msfs2020/                    MSFS 2020 in-game toolbar panel (HTML/JS + packagers).
tests/
  MetarViewer.Core.Tests/            Shared-logic tests.
  MetarViewer.App.Avalonia.Tests/    View-model tests for the Avalonia app.
```

Both desktop projects reference `MetarViewer.Core`; Core references neither. Any METAR
or airport logic worth sharing belongs in Core.

### Build and run the desktop apps

Both shipping desktop apps (Windows `.exe` and macOS `.dmg`) are built from
`MetarViewer.App.Avalonia`, which runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows:

```bash
dotnet build src/MetarViewer.App.Avalonia
dotnet run --project src/MetarViewer.App.Avalonia
```

`MetarViewer.App.WinUI` is a **Windows-native alternative UI** that is not currently
shipped in releases. It must be built from Windows:

```bash
dotnet build src/MetarViewer.App.WinUI
dotnet run --project src/MetarViewer.App.WinUI
```

On macOS and Linux, `dotnet build MetarViewer.sln` deliberately *skips* the WinUI
project rather than failing: it is mapped to the `x64` solution platform only, so the
default `Any CPU` build stays green everywhere. Building it directly off Windows fails
with `NETSDK1100`, which is expected.

> The WinUI project provides a Windows-native look, but is not currently included in
> releases and its build has not been verified since the Phase 1 refactor (see
> [docs/PHASE-5-HANDOFF.md](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/blob/main/docs/PHASE-5-HANDOFF.md)).

### Local .NET SDK setup

`global.json` pins the SDK to `8.0.418` with `rollForward: latestFeature`, which only
resolves to an `8.0.4xx` SDK. If your system-wide `dotnet` is a different major version,
commands fail with an error that looks like a broken solution file:

```text
The application 'sln' does not exist or is not a managed .dll or .exe
A compatible .NET SDK was not found.
Requested SDK version: 8.0.418
```

The solution file is fine; the SDK simply cannot be resolved. Install the pinned SDK
into the gitignored `./.dotnet` directory:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-dotnet.sh
```

The script reads the version from `global.json`, is safe to re-run, and leaves your
system-wide .NET installation alone. `.vscode/settings.json` already points the C#
extension and integrated terminal at `./.dotnet`, so **reload the VS Code window**
afterwards ("Developer: Reload Window") for new terminals to pick it up.

From an external terminal, either call `./.dotnet/dotnet` directly or export:

```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT="$PWD/.dotnet"
export PATH="$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH"
```

Then build and test as usual:

```bash
dotnet build MetarViewer.sln
dotnet test MetarViewer.sln
```

Installing the .NET 8 SDK system-wide satisfies the pin without the bootstrap step. CI
needs none of this: the workflows use `actions/setup-dotnet` with `dotnet-version: 8.0.x`.

## Build from source

### MSFS 2020 package

The integration lives under [`integrations/msfs2020`](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/blob/main/integrations/msfs2020). There are
two ways to produce an installable ZIP.

**SDK build (authoritative).** Requires Windows, the current MSFS 2020 SDK, and Node.js.
It validates the source, compiles the panel registration into a real `.spb`, validates
the generated package, and writes the ZIP to `integrations/msfs2020/Packages/`.

**Portable build (no SDK).** Runs anywhere Python 3.9+ is available, including macOS and
Linux, and writes the ZIP to `builds/`:

```bash
python3 integrations/msfs2020/tools/build-community-package.py
```

This generates `manifest.json` and `layout.json` itself and ships the toolbar
registration as XML under the `.spb` filename, which the simulator's loader generally
accepts. It is the quickest path to a ZIP you can drop into Community, but the SDK build
remains authoritative.

Panel tests run from `integrations/msfs2020` with:

```text
node --test
node tools\validate-source.mjs .
```

See [integrations/msfs2020/README.md](https://github.com/shay2000/METAR-Translator/blob/main/integrations/msfs2020/README.md) for the full
maintainer workflow.

> `integrations/msfs2020/PackageSources/.../metar-core.js` is a **separate JavaScript
> implementation** of the decoding logic, because the simulator panel cannot load .NET
> assemblies. Behavioural fixes made in `MetarViewer.Core` must be mirrored there by hand.
> The MSFS integration is therefore not a .NET project and cannot be referenced with
> `dotnet add reference`; it appears in `MetarViewer.sln` as a solution folder only.

## Releases

Each platform gets its **own** GitHub Release and maintains an independent version
sequence, so the Releases page lists clearly labelled downloads for each track:

| Release | Tag | Workflow | Asset | Runner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| METAR Viewer for Windows | `win-v1.2.3` | `windows-release.yml` | `METAR-Viewer-Windows-x64-*.exe` | `windows-latest` |
| METAR Viewer for Mac | `mac-v1.2.3` | `mac-release.yml` | Apple Silicon **and** Intel `.dmg` | `macos-14` |
| METAR Viewer for MSFS 2020 | `msfs-v1.2.3` | `msfs-release.yml` | `metar-viewer-toolbar.zip` | `ubuntu-latest` |

`release.yml` ("Release all platforms") is the entry point. Every code push to `main`,
or a manual **Actions → Release all platforms → Run workflow**, will:

1. Pick the next patch version independently for Windows, Mac, and MSFS (or use the
   optional shared version override), skipping any already tagged.
2. Create `win-v*`, `mac-v*`, and `msfs-v*` in a single atomic push, so the three
   tags describe the same source commit even when their version numbers differ.
3. Call the three platform workflows in parallel, each publishing its own release.

The Windows release carries the **Latest** badge; the other two are published with
`--latest=false` so they do not compete for it. The three platform jobs are independent,
so a failure in one still lets the other two publish.

To rebuild a single platform, push just that tag — for example
`git push origin mac-v1.2.3` — or dispatch that platform's workflow directly.

> **Why `release.yml` calls the other workflows instead of only pushing tags.** GitHub
> does not raise workflow-triggering events for refs created with the default
> `GITHUB_TOKEN`, to stop workflows triggering themselves. The retired
> `auto-release.yml` pushed a `v*` tag and expected the tag-triggered release workflow
> to notice, which never happened — that is why `v1.0.3`–`v1.0.6` were tagged but only
> ever released by hand. `workflow_call` invokes each platform workflow in-process, so
> no event delivery is involved and no personal access token is required.
