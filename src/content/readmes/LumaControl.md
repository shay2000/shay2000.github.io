## What is LumaControl?

LumaControl is an independently maintained macOS display-control app for brightness, volume, contrast, synchronization, and extended XDR brightness.

It began as a fork of [MonitorControl](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl) and is being developed as its own project, with a focus on current macOS releases, native-feeling UI, and new display-control ideas.

## What this project adds

- **Extended XDR brightness** beyond the standard 100% range, with confirmation and quick reset/disable controls.
- **Display-aware synchronization** that respects each display's available range.
- **Modern macOS support** with ongoing maintenance for the latest macOS and Xcode releases.
- **Universal builds** for Apple Silicon and Intel, with CI builds and unit tests.
- **Independent signed updates** through this project's Sparkle feed.

## Features

- Brightness, volume, and contrast controls from the menu bar or keyboard.
- DDC, native Apple display control, gamma dimming, and shade control.
- Native brightness and volume OSD on supported displays.
- Multiple displays, keyboard shortcuts, smooth transitions, and extensive preferences.

## Install

Download the latest universal DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/shay2000/LumaControl/releases), then copy **LumaControl** to `/Applications`.

The distributed build is currently ad-hoc signed. If macOS blocks the first launch, right-click the app and choose **Open**, or run:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LumaControl.app
```

Keyboard shortcuts may require **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** permission.

## Build

Requirements: Xcode, SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, and BartyCrouch.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shay2000/LumaControl.git
cd LumaControl
./build/build.sh
```

Or open `MonitorControl.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Dependencies resolve through Swift Package Manager.

## Releases

Push a version tag to build and publish a universal DMG:

```sh
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

Build numbers must increase so installed copies can receive Sparkle updates.

## Support LumaControl

LumaControl is built and maintained in my spare time, and it will always be free. If it earns a place in your menu bar, you can buy me a coffee:
